Read in the CSVs
```{r}
hasID <- read.csv('newrest.csv')
hasQA <- read.csv('rescoverage2.csv')
```

Ok, let's name the columns appropriately
```{r}
colnames(hasQA) <- c('path','coverage','pass')
colnames(hasID) <- c('bblid', 'path')
```

Now, let's merge these by path
```{r}
hasBoth <- merge(hasID, hasQA, by = 'path')
```

Let's get rid of the junk
```{r}
goodstuff <- hasBoth[,c('bblid', 'pass')]
```

Let's output to a csv
```{r}
write.csv(goodstuff, 'coverageQAbyID.csv')
```
